"""Tier-1 tests for the period syntax-drift scanner.

The Flesch-Kincaid formula is well-defined math, so these tests
pin behaviour rather than fixture-prose taste:

  - syllable counting hits the documented edge cases
    (`the`, `little`, silent-e),
  - FK grade rises monotonically with longer sentences /
    longer words,
  - drift detection respects the threshold and the absolute-delta
    semantics,
  - baseline resolution prefers voice.md > seed.txt > median,
  - missing baselines fail closed (no flags) instead of crashing.
