"""Tier-1 tests for `autonovel refresh-templates`.

Catches the bug class: a user runs `autonovel new-series`, then
later a fix lands in the package's `templates/series/typeset/`,
and the user's series silently keeps the stale copy. The
2026-04-25 PDF running-header fix and the 2026-04-28 chapter-title
fix would both have been invisible to in-flight series without
this command.
