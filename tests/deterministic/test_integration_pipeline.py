"""Multi-stage pipeline integration tests (Tier-1, no LLM).

Background: each command has unit tests in isolation, but real bugs
hit the *seams* between commands — draft writes a chapter, eval
writes a score, next-step decides; promote-canon empties the
pending file, next-step decides; etc. FUTURE-TODOS #5.2 prescribes
a deterministic test suite that walks these seams by simulating
exactly the on-disk state each command would have produced (no
real LLM call) and asserting the next-step recommendation between
each step.

These tests intentionally bypass `lifecycle.begin/end` postambles
so they exercise the inference path the postamble itself uses
(`_next_step_for`) without recursion. The promote-canon step calls
the real helper at `autonovel.promote_canon.promote`.
