# Teaser craft — how to make a 1–3 minute AI-video teaser

> **Who this is for:** anyone using autonovel's movie-teaser mode —

A teaser sells a **tone and a question**, not the plot. Done right, a
90-second teaser made of cheap AI clips can feel like a real film. This
guide is the opinionated craft autonovel applies — every default here is
overridable, and `/autonovel:teaser-coach` will explain any of it in the
context of *your* story.

---

## 0. The story spine — do this *before* picking a single shot

The most common failure mode of an AI teaser is that it goes nowhere: a
set of pretty clips of the same characters standing where and when they
are, no question, no stakes, nobody saying anything that tells you what the
story *is*. The fix is upstream of the visuals — fix the **spine** first,
then every beat serves it. `teaser-beats` writes the spine into `beats.md`;
`shot-prompts` copies it into `teaser.json`; `teaser-critique` checks the
beats actually answer it. The six spine fields (Phase 6 best practices):

- **Dramatic question (bp 1)** — the ONE question the teaser poses and
  **never answers.** "Can a clerk outlast the bank that owns his country?"
  Every beat must advance or complicate it; a beat that doesn't touch the
  question is cut. This is the throughline that makes the cut *go
  somewhere*.
- **Logline (bp 6)** — the one-sentence premise the **text cards** carry.
- **Want + opposing force (bp 4)** — what the protagonist wants and the
  concrete force in the way. Conflict is the intrigue; without a stated
  opposition the teaser has nothing to escalate.
- **Emotional arc (bp 8)** — the tonal journey ("quiet unease → mounting
  dread → defiant hope"). The cut should *move* along it: hook holds,
  escalation tightens, button breathes.
- **Score direction (bp 8)** — the single building musical cue the whole
  cut rides (real trailers ride *one* score, not per-shot music; see §7 and
  `teaser-render --score`).
- **Genre/tone (bp 9)** — what *kind* of story this is. The **hook must
  telegraph the genre in the first ~10 s** — a viewer should know they're
  watching a historical thriller (or a gothic romance, …) before they know
  the plot.

The arc the spine rides — enforce the **4-act order** and a **rising
ladder**:

- **4-act order (bp 2).** Exactly one **hook** (first shot, signals the
  genre) → **escalation** (the middle) → **title** (~⅔ in) → **button**
  (last). `teaser-critique` flags `hook-not-first`, `multiple-hooks`,
  `no-title`, `button-not-last`, `title-after-button`.
- **Rising stakes ladder (bp 3).** Give each escalation shot a
  `stakes_level` that strictly increases in shot order — the cut must
  escalate, not idle. `teaser-critique` flags `no-stakes-ladder` (unranked)
  and `stakes-not-rising` (dips).
- **Withhold the answer (bp 7).** The button deepens the question and never
  shows the resolution — that's what the film/book is for.
- **Restraint — scope without context (bp 10).** Cut any shot that is
  merely "the character standing where/when they are." Keep only shots that
  turn the question or imply a larger world. Do more with less.
- **One hero face (bp 11).** Build the teaser on ONE protagonist's stakes;
  ≤3 named faces, the rest silhouettes/crowd (no consistency lock needed).
  `teaser-critique` flags `cast-sprawl` above three named faces.

Two more best practices that turn the spine into something a viewer can
read:

- **Dialogue as payload, not ambience (bp 5).** A teaser must let you
  *hear* the story. Mine **3-6 of the highest-voltage lines** from the
  manuscript — a threat, a vow, a cost named aloud — adapt them short, and
  spread them across the arc (the sharpest just before the title/button).
  Generic chatter teaches the viewer nothing; loaded lines reveal a stake,
  a relationship, or the genre in one breath. (Only spoken on
  native-audio providers; otherwise carry them as text cards.)
- **Stakes ladder, not a montage of equals.** Order the escalation beats
  so each one's cost / danger / irreversibility exceeds the one before. If
  beat 6 isn't scarier than beat 3, re-order or cut.

`teaser-critique` raises `no-dramatic-question`, `no-logline`, `no-stakes`,
`no-emotional-arc`, `no-genre`, `thin-dialogue`, and `thin-text-cards` when
these are missing — treat them as must-fix, not advisory. **They are the
render gate (bp 12):** `/autonovel:teaser-render` *refuses* to spend a real
generation while any of them is present (the offline `stub` backend and
single-`--shot` runs are exempt; `--skip-narrative-gate` overrides). You
literally cannot burn quota on a teaser that has no story — fix it for free
first, or validate the chain offline with `--provider stub`.

## 1. The words: beat → scene → shot → clip

Four terms, used consistently:

- **Beat** — one story turning point ("she discovers the ledger is
  forged"). A teaser is built from ~8–20 beats.
- **Scene** — a continuous unit in one place + time. A scene may hold
  several beats.
- **Shot** — one camera setup: one framing, one move. *This is the unit
  a video model renders.* One scene → many shots.
- **Clip** — the actual generated 4–10-second video for one shot.
  Usually 2–4 takes per shot; keep the best.

The pipeline: **story → beats → scenes → shots → clips → cut.**

## 2. The dual-audience problem (the one big idea)

A scene description has to satisfy two readers who want opposite things:

| Reader | Wants | Hates |
|---|---|---|
| **You** (editing) | meaning, emotion, why the beat matters | a dry list of nouns |
| **The video model** | concrete visible nouns, one action, present tense, what's literally in frame | interiority, abstraction, metaphor, backstory |

So each shot is written **twice**: a one-line *beat note* you understand,
and a *shot prompt* the model obeys. Example:

- **Beat note:** *Tommaso realises the accounts don't balance — the
  moment the conspiracy becomes real to him.*
- **Shot prompt:** *Medium close-up, low-angle. TOMMASO (late 20s,
  ink-stained fingers, plain woollen doublet) snaps the ledger shut, jaw
  tightening, one slow exhale. Candlelit counting-house, ledgers stacked
  behind. Warm low-key light, amber/walnut palette. Slow push-in. 85mm,
  shallow depth of field. Shot on 35mm film. Tense.*

## 3. Externalise interiority (film shows; it can't narrate)

Novels live in thought ("she wondered if he'd betray her"). A camera can
only show **behaviour**. Convert every interior state into a visible
action:

- *anxious* → grips the table edge, jaw tight, one hard swallow
- *suspicious* → eyes flick to the door, hand drifts off the cup
- *triumphant* → the smallest smile, shoulders drop

(This is the same show-don't-tell discipline the writing pipeline uses —
run forward: interiority → action.)

## 4. Rules for a shot description the model will obey

- **One subject doing one thing; one camera move.** Multi-action clips
  fall apart.
- **Present tense, active, concrete.** "Rain hammers the cobbles," not
  "it had been raining."
- **Only what's in frame.** No backstory, no off-screen cause, no
  "because."
- **No un-filmable abstraction.** "Her world collapses" → pick the
  visible image that *means* that.
- **Name the subject identically every time** — reusing the exact
  appearance words keeps the character consistent across clips.
- **No legible on-screen text** — make title/subtitle cards in the
  editor, not the model (models garble text).
- **No real people or trademarked characters** (also a competition-rules
  issue).

## 5. Cinematography words that actually work

Use *these* terms — the models are trained on them:

- **Shot sizes:** extreme close-up · close-up · medium · wide /
  establishing · over-the-shoulder · POV · two-shot.
- **Angles:** eye-level · low-angle · high-angle · bird's-eye · dutch.
- **Camera moves:** static · pan · tilt · dolly in/out · truck · zoom
  in/out · crane · aerial/drone · handheld · orbit · push-in / pull-out
  · dolly-zoom (vertigo).
- **Lens/optical:** wide-angle · telephoto · shallow depth of field /
  bokeh · rack focus · lens flare · "85mm" / "35mm handheld".
- **Lighting:** golden hour · moonlight · firelight · neon · low-key ·
  high-key · Rembrandt · film-noir shadows · volumetric rays ·
  backlight/silhouette.
- **Look / film stock:** "shot on 35mm film" · anamorphic · "cinematic
  film look" · era looks ("1980s vaporwave", "1920s sepia + grain").
- **Palette:** name **3–5 colour anchors** ("amber, cream, walnut") and
  hold them across every shot — this is what makes the edit seamless.
- **Temporal:** slow-motion · time-lapse.

autonovel pulls the era look from your `project.yaml` period/region and
the palette/grade from `art/visual_style.json`, so you don't type these
by hand. It also renders the prompt in each provider's **dialect** — full
prose for Veo/Sora (and the generic/Pollinations default), terse
comma-separated keywords for Runway, a concise description plus a Luma
camera-motion enum for Luma — automatically from `--provider`. Same
facts, the shape each tool wants.

## 6. Keeping a character consistent across clips

The hardest part. The workflow that works:

1. Generate a **canonical reference image** of each character and key
   location first.
2. Feed that image as the **reference / first frame** of every clip with
   that subject.
3. **Reuse the exact appearance description** in every prompt.
4. Hold **lighting logic + the 3–5 colour palette** identical.
5. Chain **last frame of one clip → first frame of the next** for
   continuous action.

Honest caveat: identity still drifts sometimes. Reference images reduce
it; they don't perfect it. Lean on them and pick the best takes.

**Locations + age (Phase 7).** Lock **places** the same way you lock faces:
`teaser-refs --with-locations` scaffolds one reference plate per distinct
setting, so the same place recurs *and* renders period-correctly — declare
a period-accurate source (the wooden Rialto, not the 1591 stone bridge) to
dodge the anachronism a naïve search returns. For a character who **ages**
across the story, give them an `appearance_ages` ladder (boy 14 → youth 18
→ man 40 → elder 62, parallel to the `voice_ages` voice ladder); the render
picks the age-correct appearance text for each shot's `story_year` so the
prompt matches the life-stage plate. With `--refs`, approved character AND
location plates flow into the image *and* video backends (a shot with no
keyframe uses its primary plate as the image-to-video start frame).

`/autonovel:shot-prompts` assigns each recurring subject a canonical
reference path (`teaser/refs/<name>.png`) and runs
`autonovel mechanical teaser-refs-plan`, which tells you exactly which
reference images you still need to make, which shots use each, and
whether a `shared/art_references/` plate already covers one — so you're
never grepping the refs dir by hand.

## 7. Creative defaults — your first-timer questions, answered

Opinionated starting points (all overridable; `/autonovel:teaser-coach`
explains each against your story).

### How long is a shot? a scene? the teaser?

| | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| One **shot** | **2–4 s** | Clips are short; trailers cut fast. Over-generate, pick best. |
| The **hook** | one **4–6 s** shot | The opening image needs room to land. |
| **Escalation** cuts | down to **1–2 s** | Accelerating cuts = rising tension. |
| **Final image** | **3–5 s** hold | Let the last beat breathe. |
| **30 s** teaser | **~8–12 shots** | Good debug size. |
| **3:00** teaser (X-Prize) | **~35–60 shots** | The competition target. |

### How many characters?

**One hero face; at most 2–3 named faces total.** More faces = more
identity drift and less emotional clarity. A teaser sells *one* person's
stakes. Crowds, silhouettes, and backs-of-heads are free — they don't
need consistency locking.

### How do I hook people in the first 5 seconds?

Pick one — and **intrigue, don't explain** (no exposition up front):

- the **strongest single image** in your world;
- a **dramatic question** — a situation that demands "…what happens
  next?";
- a **provocative line** (text card or one spoken line) — *"They told us
  the war was over."*;
- **disorientation → orientation** — a strange close-up, then pull out
  to reveal the world.

### The ending — do I hint at it or keep it a surprise?

- **Default: tease the *question*, withhold the *answer*.** Show the
  stakes and the world; never show the resolution. End on the unanswered
  question, or a "button" (a final hook *after* the title card) that
  deepens the mystery.
- **For the X-Prize:** the brief asks you to "show a future worth
  building," so the **vision** is often the point — **reveal the vision,
  withhold the journey.** Show the hopeful destination; hint that
  humanity *earns* it through struggle; hide the road.
- **Never** spoil a twist or the final emotional beat — that's what the
  film is for.

### Other sensible defaults

| Knob | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Aspect ratio | **16:9** | Festival/competition standard; `9:16` for social. |
| Audio | music bed + 1–2 dialogue stings + SFX | Music carries a teaser; dialogue is sparing. |
| Text cards | **2–4 short cards** | Carry narrative cheaply; dodge AI lipsync. |
| Title card | at **~⅔** point | Brand beat before the button. |

## 8. Teaser structure (the shape of the 60–180 s)

1. **Cold hook (0–10 s)** — one arresting image or line.
2. **Escalation montage (10–60 s)** — accelerating shots, rising stakes,
   intercut with text cards; pacing tightens.
3. **Title card** (mid or ~⅔ in).
4. **Button / stinger (final 5–10 s)** — a last shock or unanswered
   question after the title.

**Music and sound design carry a teaser.** Build to a drop on the title
card; let text cards do narrative work; ramp from longer opening shots to
quick escalation cuts, then hold the final image.

## 9. When the model misbehaves

Common failures: morphing/identity drift, flicker, extra/melting limbs,
garbled text, physics breaks, unwanted camera drift.

Fixes that reliably help: use reference/first-frame images; one action +
one camera move + a short clip; render text in the editor not the model;
higher resolution; change one thing at a time; and a **negative prompt**
written as content words — `blurry, distorted hands, extra limbs,
watermark, text, subtitles, flicker, morphing`. **Never** write "no
walls" / "don't show…" — the model reads the content words, so negation
backfires.

## 10. The commands

The craft above is applied by these commands:

1. `/autonovel:treatment --book <name>` — film treatment + 2-page brief
   (reveals the ending; X-Prize-shaped by default).
2. `/autonovel:teaser --book <name> [--length 180] [--provider <p>]` —
   **the one-command pipeline.** Runs steps 2a→2b for you, each in a
   fresh subagent, and prints one summary. `--with-treatment` runs step 1
   first when no treatment exists. Or run the two sub-steps yourself if
   you want to hand-edit the beat-sheet between them:
   - 2a. `/autonovel:teaser-beats --book <name> [--length 180]` — selects
     the hook → escalation → title → button beats to a budget. Writes
     `teaser/beats.md` (edit it freely).
   - 2b. `/autonovel:shot-prompts --book <name> [--provider <p>]` — turns
     beats into provider-ready shot prompts, runs a free pre-generation
     critique, and writes `teaser/teaser.json` + `teaser/shots/shot_*.md`.
3. `/autonovel:teaser-critique --book <name>` — re-run the free critique
   (mechanical linter + LLM critic) on a hand-edited `teaser.json`; writes
   an advisory `teaser/critique.md`. Read-only on the teaser.
4. `/autonovel:teaser-render --book <name> [--provider <p>] [--kind auto|image|video] [--dry-run]`
   — render the prompts into actual clips. On a fresh teaser it first
   validates the chain **free and offline** via the `stub` backend (local
   placeholder keyframes — no network/key/quota), then renders real video
   on **`grok`** (free dialogue+music, no card) or another backend; a
   vision critique marks each clip **KEEP / REGENERATE / UPGRADE-TO-PAID**.
   Clips land in `teaser/clips/`; stateless, nothing assembled. `--dry-run`
   shows the plan + key status for $0. Backend/key map:
   `docs/teaser-render-providers.md`.
5. `/autonovel:teaser-assemble --book <name> [--audio <path>]` — stitch
   the clips into one teaser video with ffmpeg (via an editable
   `teaser/cut_list.json`), then a **viewer-panel cut critique** judges
   the whole cut (does the hook land, does it accelerate, does the button
   withhold?) → `teaser/assembly-report.md`. v1 is hard cuts; add the
   title/subtitle cards in an editor (models garble text — §4).

Steps 1–3 are free with no generation; step 4 validates the whole chain
for **$0/zero-quota** via the offline `stub` backend before spending a
real backend's limited free generations (`grok` = 5/day) — see
`docs/teaser-render-providers.md`; step 5 runs ffmpeg locally.

**Re-running the whole pipeline (Phase 6).** Passing `--force` to
`/autonovel:teaser` / `teaser-beats` / `shot-prompts` regenerates the
scripts, but first **archives the previous `beats.md` / `teaser.json` to
`teaser/script-takes/<name>_<UTC>.<ext>`** — so you never lose a script you
preferred (re-promote one by copying it back). The character/location
**reference originals in `teaser/refs/` are untouched**: a full re-run
changes the scripts while reusing the approved portraits and location
plates. Rendered clips are likewise versioned (`teaser-takes`, Phase 5.8).
