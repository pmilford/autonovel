"""Build a `back_matter.tex` for typeset's PDF path.

Reads optional `appendix.md` from the book's root, converts paragraphs
via the existing md_to_latex pipeline, wraps each in a starred
chapter heading (`\\chapter*{}` so it's unnumbered and excluded from
the chapter numbering), and concatenates the result. The output is
`\\input{}`-able from novel.tex, in the `\\backmatter` zone (after
the last chapter).

The `\\backmatter` LaTeX command must precede this content (already
the case in novel.tex). When the appendix doesn't exist, returns
("", []) and the typeset workflow simply doesn't write
`back_matter.tex` — novel.tex's `\\IfFileExists` then silently skips
inclusion.

Why a separate module from front_matter.py: front and back matter
sit in different LaTeX zones (`\\frontmatter` vs `\\backmatter`),
need different `\\input{}` lines in novel.tex, and grow at different
rates (back matter typically grows over multi-book series with
appendix sections accumulating). Keeping them in parallel files
matches the LaTeX layout and keeps the contract obvious.

Markdown shape supported (intentionally narrow — same as
front_matter.py):

  - paragraphs separated by blank lines
  - `*italic*`
  - smart-quote / em-dash / en-dash conversion
  - `---` scene breaks (rare but allowed)
  - `## Sub-heading` is allowed in appendix (unlike preface) since
    the appendix often has labelled sections (Timeline of events,
    Bios, Notes on sources, etc.). These render as `\\section*{}`
    in the LaTeX output.

Headings inside the appendix file:
  - `# Title` at the top is dropped — we emit our own canonical
    `\\chapter*{Appendix}` heading.
  - `## Section` lines are promoted to `\\section*{}` (unnumbered;
    not in the TOC by default, but appendix is itself a TOC entry
    so navigation still works).
