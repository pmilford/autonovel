"""Build a `front_matter.tex` for typeset's PDF path.

Reads optional `preface.md` (hand-authored) and `introduction.md`
(AI-generated, or hand-authored — the file is just a file) from the
book's root, converts paragraphs via the existing md_to_latex
pipeline, wraps each in a starred chapter heading (`\\chapter*{}` so
it's unnumbered and excluded from the chapter numbering), and
concatenates the result. The output is `\\input{}`-able from
novel.tex.

The `\\frontmatter` LaTeX command must precede this content (already
the case in novel.tex). When neither preface nor introduction
exists, returns ("", []) and the typeset workflow simply doesn't
write `front_matter.tex` — novel.tex's `\\IfFileExists` then
silently skips inclusion.

Markdown shape supported (intentionally narrow — the same shape
md_to_latex already handles):

  - paragraphs separated by blank lines
  - `*italic*`
  - smart-quote / em-dash / en-dash conversion
  - `---` scene breaks (rare in front matter; supported anyway)

Headings inside a preface/introduction file are NOT promoted to
`\\section{}` — front matter typically has one heading (the
chapter*) and uninterrupted prose under it. If a preface needs
sub-headings, hand-edit `front_matter.tex` after generation.
