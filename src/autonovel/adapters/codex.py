"""Codex CLI adapter — translates generic commands into Codex skills.

Codex (>= 0.125) discovers skills from `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
Each skill is a directory with a YAML-front-matter markdown file; Codex
loads the frontmatter for routing and the body when the skill is
invoked. There is no slash-command syntax — the user invokes a skill
conversationally ("run autonovel-draft for chapter 1") or by name.

We install the autonovel skills under one parent directory so uninstall
can remove the whole tree cleanly:

    ~/.codex/skills/autonovel/<stem>/SKILL.md

Codex's tool set is fixed (it has shell, file read/write, web search,
and sub-agent fan-out via its own scheduler), so the adapter's job for
the body is to translate the generic tool names that command authors
write (`file_read`, `web_search`, `bash`, …) into Codex's actual
tool/verb names so the model doesn't try to invoke a Claude-shaped tool
that does not exist. The map below is the source of truth.

Codex skills cannot pin a model per-skill; the user picks one with
`codex --model` or in `~/.codex/config.toml`. We surface the intended
tier as a `metadata.model_tier` field so a future Codex version can
honour it, and we record the resolved model name in the same metadata
block as documentation.

Before following the <workflow> below, run the autonovel preamble. This is
mechanical; it handles the lock and checkpoints described in the
autonovel rewrite plan (§21.2) so that every command is interruptible and
every destructive change is reversible.

1. Run the shell command:
   `autonovel _begin --command {cmd.name} --runtime codex --args "$ARGUMENTS"`
   The helper resolves `$ARGUMENTS` against this command's `writes:` paths
   (listed below), acquires `.autonovel/in-progress.lock`, and snapshots
   the current state of every write target into
   `.autonovel/checkpoints/<UTC-timestamp>/`. If it exits non-zero —
   another command is in flight or the series is malformed — stop and
   surface the message verbatim.

2. Only proceed to the <workflow> below once `_begin` has succeeded.

Writes this command will perform (for context):
{writes_bullet}

def _postamble(cmd: CommandDef) -> str:
    return f"""<autonovel-postamble>
After the <workflow> succeeds, run the autonovel postamble:

1. Run the shell command:
   `autonovel _end --command {cmd.name} --args "$ARGUMENTS" --status ok`
   passing `--wrote <path>` once for each file that was actually written.
   This releases the lock, writes `.autonovel/last-action.json` with the
   standard next step, and appends a JSON line to
   `.autonovel/command-log.jsonl`.

2. Print the user-facing footer exactly as emitted by `_end` (it includes
   the next standard step and a few sidequest alternatives). That footer is
   the primary UX for "what do I do next"; always show it.

If the <workflow> fails partway through:
- Run `autonovel _end --command {cmd.name} --args "$ARGUMENTS" --status error`
  (no `--wrote` paths). That leaves the lock marked `interrupted` so
  `/autonovel:resume` can offer recovery, and records the error in the
  command log without overwriting `last-action.json`.
