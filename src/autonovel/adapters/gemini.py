"""Gemini CLI adapter — translates generic commands to TOML command files.

Gemini CLI discovers user commands under `~/.gemini/commands/`, organised
in subfolders by namespace. Each command is a `.toml` file with a
`description` field and a `prompt` field; the file's path under
`commands/` becomes the slash-command name. So:

    ~/.gemini/commands/autonovel/draft.toml  →  /autonovel:draft

Tool names in Gemini differ from Claude and Codex (see §11 of
REWRITE-PLAN.md): file reads use `read_file`, web search is
`google_web_search`, sub-agent fan-out is `run_agent`. The body of the
generic command refers to tools as `file_read`, `web_search`, `task`,
etc.; this adapter rewrites those references to Gemini's vocabulary so
the model isn't asked to invoke a tool that does not exist.

Gemini CLI does not currently allow per-command model pinning, so the
intended tier is recorded as a comment-style metadata block at the top
of the prompt. Users select the model with `gemini -m <name>` or
`~/.gemini/settings.json`.

Before following the <workflow> below, run the autonovel preamble. This is
mechanical; it handles the lock and checkpoints described in the
autonovel rewrite plan (§21.2) so that every command is interruptible and
every destructive change is reversible.

1. Use the `run_shell_command` tool to run:
   `autonovel _begin --command {cmd.name} --runtime gemini --args "{{{{args}}}}"`
   The helper resolves the args against this command's `writes:` paths
   (listed below), acquires `.autonovel/in-progress.lock`, and snapshots
   the current state of every write target into
   `.autonovel/checkpoints/<UTC-timestamp>/`. If it exits non-zero —
   another command is in flight or the series is malformed — stop and
   surface the message verbatim.

2. Only proceed to the <workflow> below once `_begin` has succeeded.

Writes this command will perform (for context):

After the <workflow> succeeds, run the autonovel postamble:

1. Use the `run_shell_command` tool to run:
   `autonovel _end --command {cmd.name} --args "{{{{args}}}}" --status ok`
   passing `--wrote <path>` once for each file that was actually written.
   This releases the lock, writes `.autonovel/last-action.json` with the
   standard next step, and appends a JSON line to
   `.autonovel/command-log.jsonl`.

2. Print the user-facing footer exactly as emitted by `_end` (it includes
   the next standard step and a few sidequest alternatives). That footer is
   the primary UX for "what do I do next"; always show it.

If the <workflow> fails partway through:
- Run `autonovel _end --command {cmd.name} --args "{{{{args}}}}" --status error`
  (no `--wrote` paths). That leaves the lock marked `interrupted` so
  `/autonovel:resume` can offer recovery, and records the error in the
  command log without overwriting `last-action.json`.
