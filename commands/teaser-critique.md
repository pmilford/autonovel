<purpose>
Criticise a teaser **before generating a single clip** — the cheapest place
to fix it (PRD §24.2). `/autonovel:shot-prompts` runs this critique once,
inline, while authoring; this is the **standalone, re-runnable** version you
point at a hand-edited `books/{book}/teaser/teaser.json` to re-check it
after you've reordered shots, rewritten prompts, or changed provider.

It does **three** passes and writes a report plus a quality scorecard:

  1. **Mechanical linter** (`autonovel mechanical teaser-critique`) —
     deterministic flags: **story-spine** (no-dramatic-question, no-logline,
     no-stakes, no-emotional-arc, no-genre, thin-dialogue),
     **4-act order** (hook-not-first, multiple-hooks, no-title,
     button-not-last, title-after-button), **stakes ladder**
     (no-stakes-ladder, stakes-not-rising), **cast/legibility** (cast-sprawl,
     instrument-only-shot, unidentified-figure, too-many-cards — Phase 12
     advisories), appearance-drift, thin-prompt, no-palette, no-reference,
     multi-action, audio/negative unsupported for the provider,
     length-mismatch. The story-spine subset is the **render gate**
     (`teaser-render` refuses a real generation while any is present; `stub`
     is exempt) — bp 12. (Phase 12: `thin-text-cards` was dropped — cards are
     a crutch; legibility is enforced by the viewer-blind quality gate below.)
  2. **LLM critic** — taste the mechanics can't judge. **Story (Phase 6,
     judge first):** does the teaser pose ONE dramatic question and never
     answer it (bp 1, 7)? Does each beat advance or complicate that
     question, and do the stakes *rise* beat to beat (a ladder, not equals,
     bp 3)? Does the **hook signal the genre** in the first ~10 s (bp 9)?
     Do the mined dialogue lines actually reveal stake/relationship/genre,
     or are they filler (bp 5)? Do the text cards carry the premise (bp 6)?
     Does the cut move along the stated emotional arc (bp 8)? Is it built on
     ONE hero face (bp 11)? Is every shot earning its place, or is some shot
     just "the character standing where/when they are" — **restraint**, cut
     it (bp 10)? Does the button **withhold** the resolution (bp 7)?
     **Then per shot:** does each prompt obey
     teaser-craft §4 (one subject, one action, present tense, only what's in
     frame, no un-filmable abstraction)? Is the appearance string reused
     verbatim? Does the shot serve its beat and the arc (hook that
     intrigues, escalation that accelerates, a button that withholds the
     ending)? For X-Prize teasers: stakes, a real character, visual ambition.
  3. **Interestingness scorecard — the HARD quality gate (Phase 11).** The
     mechanical + structural passes only prove the teaser *has a story
     shape*; they cannot tell a *boring* teaser from a gripping one
     (presence ≠ interesting — the exact failure the user hit). This pass is
     the LLM judge scoring the teaser **1-10 on eight interestingness
     dimensions** and writing them to `books/{book}/teaser/quality.json`:
     `hook_grip`, `question_sharpness`, `stakes_escalation`, `character`,
     `dialogue_quality`, `surprise_turn`, `coherence`, `button` (the rubric
     prompts live in `autonovel mechanical teaser-quality --template` and
     `docs/teaser-craft.md §11`). The scorecard is the **render gate**:
     `/autonovel:teaser-render` refuses a real generation unless the teaser
     clears **overall ≥ 7 AND no single dimension < 5** — so "boring" is now
     a measurable, blocking failure, not a silent pass. Score honestly and
     harshly; a generous 7 spends real money on a dull teaser.

This command is **read-only on `teaser.json`** — it never mutates the shot
data (that is `/autonovel:shot-prompts`' job, or your own hand-edit). It
writes an advisory report (`critique.md`) plus the machine-readable
`quality.json` scorecard, with concrete, copy-pasteable rewrite suggestions
so you can apply the ones you agree with. No image/video tool is called; it
is free.
</purpose>

<workflow>
**Read-failure policy.** `books/{book}/teaser/teaser.json` is load-bearing —
stop if it is missing (run `/autonovel:shot-prompts` first). Treat
`books/{book}/treatment.md` and `books/{book}/art/visual_style.json` as
best-effort context for judging on-brief-ness and palette discipline; note
gaps and proceed without retrying.

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Required: `--book <short-name>`. Optional:
   `--provider <name>` (default: the `provider` recorded in `teaser.json`,
   else `generic`). Confirm the book exists in `project.yaml`.

2. **Mechanical pass.** Use `bash`:
   `autonovel mechanical teaser-critique books/{book}/teaser/teaser.json --provider <name> --format json`
   Parse the JSON `findings` (each `{shot_id, level, code, message}`). Also
   run `autonovel mechanical teaser-validate books/{book}/teaser/teaser.json --provider <name> --format json`
   so the report states whether the teaser is structurally valid.

3. **Load context (best-effort).** `file_read`
   `books/{book}/treatment.md` (what the film is, the real ending — so you
   can judge whether the button withholds it) and
   `books/{book}/art/visual_style.json` (the canonical palette anchors — so
   you can flag a shot whose palette drifts from the series grade).

4. **LLM critic pass.** `file_read` `books/{book}/teaser/teaser.json`.
   **First judge the story spine** (`docs/teaser-craft.md` §0): is there a
   real dramatic question that stays unanswered? do the beats answer it and
   escalate? is there a stated want + opposing force? do the dialogue lines
   and text cards make the story legible, or would a viewer "learn nothing"?
   does the cut move along the emotional arc? Then, for each shot, judge
   against `docs/teaser-craft.md` §4 (AI-legibility) and §6 (consistency),
   and against the beat it serves:
   - **Legibility:** one subject, one action, one camera move, present
     tense, concrete, only-what's-in-frame, no un-filmable abstraction,
     content-word negatives (never "no …"). **Diegetic-text conflict:** flag
     any shot whose subject is written material (ledger/letter/map/sign) but
     whose `negative_prompt` includes `text`/`letters`/`words`/`numbers` —
     that suppresses the subject; the fix is to drop those terms (overlay
     title type is handled separately on `role: title`). REWRITE it.
   - **Consistency:** the subject's appearance string is identical to every
     other shot with that subject; palette holds the 3-5 anchors.
   - **Service:** the shot earns its place — the hook intrigues without
     explaining *and signals the genre* (bp 9), escalation shots accelerate
     and raise stakes on a rising ladder (bp 3), the title lands ~⅔ in, the
     button deepens the question and does NOT reveal the resolution (bp 7).
     **Restraint** (bp 10): flag any shot that is just "the character
     standing where/when they are" — REWRITE or cut. **Cast** (bp 11): one
     hero face; demote extra named faces. (X-Prize: stakes + a real
     character + visual ambition + an *earned* optimistic future.)
   Rank shots worst-first; for each weak shot, write a one-line diagnosis
   and a concrete rewritten prompt suggestion.

4b. **Score the interestingness rubric → `quality.json` (Phase 11, the HARD
   gate).** Structure is not enough — judge whether the teaser is actually
   *interesting*. `bash`: `autonovel mechanical teaser-quality --template`
   to get the scaffold (the eight dimension keys + the exact question each
   asks). Score **each dimension 1-10**, judging honestly and harshly
   against the *story*, not the prompt mechanics:
   - `hook_grip` — would a stranger keep watching past ~10 s?
   - `question_sharpness` — is the dramatic question sharp and specific to
     THIS story, not a generic "will they survive?"
   - `stakes_escalation` — do the stakes rise, specific + felt + irreversible?
   - `character` — do we learn who someone IS / wants / what it costs?
   - `dialogue_quality` — subtext, voice, ≥1 quotable line — not filler?
   - `surprise_turn` — is there a real turn/reversal (the spine `turn`)?
   - `coherence` — does it add up to ONE legible story?
   - `button` — does it withhold the resolution AND deepen the question?
   For each dimension add a one-line `note` saying *why* the score and
   *what would lift it* (these drive `/autonovel:teaser-revise`).

4c. **The viewer-blind legibility read — the un-gameable half of the gate
   (Phase 12).** The scores in 4b are not trusted on their own: you wrote
   the teaser, so you can see its *intent* (the spine, the names, the
   beat-notes) and will grade the script you meant, not the experience a
   stranger gets. (That is exactly how a boring teaser passed with eloquent
   8s.) So now judge it **as a first-time viewer who knows nothing about the
   book.** For each shot, build the **perceivable layer ONLY** — the visible
   `action`, the spoken `audio.dialogue` line, and any on-screen `text_card`
   — and **deliberately ignore** `subject.name`, `identify`, `spine`,
   `beat_note`, and `stakes_level` (a viewer can't see those). Then answer,
   honestly and skeptically (default to "I can't tell"):
   - **who** is on screen? (If the figure isn't named in dialogue or carried
     by an `identify` lower-third, the viewer does NOT know — that's a
     stranger in costume.)
   - **what** is happening? (An object shot — a ledger, a wax seal, a
     riderless horse — usually fails: a stranger sees a horse, not "the
     courier was intercepted.")
   - **why** does it matter to the story?
   Mark each shot `clear: true` only if a stranger could answer all three
   from the perceivable layer alone. Record the read as the `legibility`
   array (`[{shot_id, clear, who, what, why, note}]`). Then write the
   **`viewer_takeaway`** ("a stranger comes away believing: ___") and
   **`would_watch`** (would that stranger want the film?). Be ruthless: if
   the teaser is a tour of objects with no identified people, most scenes are
   `clear: false`, `would_watch: false` — say so.

4d. **Write + check the scorecard.** `file_write` the full
   `books/{book}/teaser/quality.json` (schema `teaser-quality/2`: `genre`,
   `scores`, `notes`, `legibility`, `viewer_takeaway`, `would_watch`). Then
   `bash`:
   `autonovel mechanical teaser-quality books/{book}/teaser/quality.json --format json`
   — **exit 3 = BLOCK**, exit 0 = PASS. The gate now blocks on a low score
   *or* any illegible scene *or* a teaser a stranger wouldn't watch. Be a
   tough judge: the whole point is that a structurally-complete-but-boring or
   illegible teaser must FAIL. If you are tempted to give everything a 7 and
   mark every scene clear, you are repeating the bug — look harder for the
   object shot a stranger can't read, the unnamed figure, the on-the-nose
   line.

5. **Write `books/{book}/teaser/critique.md`** — an advisory report:

   ```markdown
   # {Display Title} — Teaser critique

   ```

6. Print a one-screen summary that **leads with the render-gate verdict and
   the exact next command** (this is the line the user acts on — make it
   unambiguous). The render gate is now **two gates** — the structural
   story-spine gate AND the Phase-11 quality gate — and a real render needs
   BOTH green. Branch on the combined verdict:

   **If BOTH gates pass** (no story-spine must-fix flags AND quality PASS):
   ```
   ✅ Render gate: READY — story complete + quality {overall}/10.
        books/{book}/teaser/critique.md + quality.json written.
        {k} advisory flag(s) left ({r}/{n} shots could be sharpened).
   Next: /autonovel:teaser-render --book {book} --provider stub   (validate free)
         then a real backend.
   ```

   **If EITHER gate blocks** (story flags remain OR quality < bar):
   ```
   ⚠️ Render gate: BLOCKED.
        Story: {READY | {m} must-fix flag(s): codes}.
        Quality: {PASS overall/10 | BLOCK overall/10 — weakest: dim=n, dim=n}.
        Full report: books/{book}/teaser/critique.md (+ quality.json).
   Next: /autonovel:teaser-revise --book {book}
         — APPLIES these fixes to teaser.json in place (fills the spine,
         lifts the weak quality dimensions, runs the de-boring pass) — no
         hand edits, no regenerate. Then this command re-scores. (For a clean
         re-author instead, /autonovel:shot-prompts --book {book} --force.)
   ```

   Always name `/autonovel:teaser-revise` as the way to ACT on the findings
   — the user should never be left to hand-edit unless they want to.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- `books/{book}/teaser/critique.md` exists with a `## Verdict`, a
  `## Story spine` section (dramatic question / want vs. force / genre /
  emotional arc / dialogue + text-card counts / 4-act order / stakes ladder
  / named faces / **render-gate READY-or-BLOCKED**, flagging any missing), a
  `## Quality score` section (the eight dimensions 1-10 + overall + verdict +
  weakest), a `## Mechanical flags` section reflecting the linter output, and
  per-shot notes that mark each shot KEEP or REWRITE.
- `books/{book}/teaser/quality.json` (schema `teaser-quality/2`) is written
  with all eight dimensions scored 1-10 AND a viewer-blind `legibility` read
  (one `{shot_id, clear, who, what, why}` per shot, judged from the
  perceivable layer only), a `viewer_takeaway`, and `would_watch`. The
  *verdict* may be BLOCK — that is the gate doing its job; an illegible or
  boring teaser MUST fail it.
- The report states whether `teaser.json` is structurally valid (from
  `teaser-validate`) and never mutates `teaser.json`.
- Every mechanical flag from `autonovel mechanical teaser-critique` appears
  in the report; the LLM pass adds taste judgements the linter cannot make.
- No image/video provider is called; the command is free and re-runnable.
