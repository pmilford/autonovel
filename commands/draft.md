<purpose>
Write chapter `{chapter}` of book `{book}` as full prose, obeying the series
voice, world, characters, outline beats, and canon. Respect story-time:
chapters from other books with `story_time` less than or equal to this
chapter's `story_time` are readable context; chapters later in story-time are
off-limits.
</purpose>

<workflow>
**Read-failure policy.** When `file_read` errors (file not found,
permission denied, encoding error) on any input that's NOT the
load-bearing chapter file, do NOT retry. Note the gap in your
working memory + the postamble's eval-log write, and proceed
without that input. The author hit retry-loops 2026-04-25 on
non-existent prior chapters and on summary files that hadn't
been backfilled yet; the right response is "this prose-context
input is missing, draft anyway with what's available". The single
exception is reads that load the chapter we're writing-against
(`/autonovel:revise` step 6); those are the *only* truly
required reads — surface the error and stop, don't retry.

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Expect `<chapter-number> --book <short-name>`. If the
   chapter number or `--book` is missing, stop and print a one-line usage
   reminder. Do not touch disk.

2. Use `file_read` on `project.yaml`. Resolve the book entry, its `pov`, and
   the defaults block (`chapter_target_words`, `chapter_threshold`).

3. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/outline.md`. Locate the entry for chapter
   `{chapter}`. Capture its beats, its `story_time`, and any events it
   references. If the chapter is not in the outline, stop and surface the gap.

4. Use `file_read` on `shared/world.md`, `shared/characters.md`,
   `shared/canon.md`, and `shared/events.md`. For every event the outline
   references, use only the `canonical` field and this book's
   `rendered_in` row from `shared/events.md` — ignore other books' POV rows.

5. Use `file_read` on any `shared/research/notes/*.md` that the outline entry
   for this chapter names explicitly. Do not load the full research tree.

6. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/voice.md`. Parts 1 (series voice),
   2 (book fingerprint), 3 (custom rubric, when present), AND 4
   (per-character voice fingerprints, when present) are all in
   scope.

   Part 3 lists book-specific writing rules that must be honoured
   at draft time — drafting against the rules is cheaper than
   revising back to them. Treat each Part 3 bullet as a hard
   constraint on the chapter's prose.

   Part 4 lists per-character voice fingerprints. When present,
   apply each character's block at every line of their dialogue
   AND (for the POV character) at every interiority sentence.
   This is the antidote to the "all characters sound the same"
   AI tell — without per-character voicing, every speaker tends
   to converge on the narrator's register. Verify before writing
   each dialogue exchange: which character is speaking, what's
   in their Part 4 block, does the line you're about to write
   honour Speech / Verbal tics / Refuses? If Part 4 is empty or
   absent (solo-cast book, or the cast threshold wasn't met),
   fall back to Part 2 alone.

7. **Best-effort prior-chapter quote (do not retry on failure).** Use
   the `Bash` tool to run, exactly once:

   ```
   autonovel _tail-chapter --book {book} --chapter {prev} --words 1000
   ```

   The helper reads `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{prev}.md`, strips any
   YAML frontmatter, and prints the last 1000 words to stdout — no
   `file_read` line-range gymnastics. If the prior chapter doesn't
   exist, the helper exits zero with no output; that's normal for
   chapter 1. Capture the
   stdout as your continuity flavour. **Do not retry** on any failure
   (non-zero exit, empty output, error message): note the gap as a
   one-line observation you'll repeat in the postamble's eval-log
   write, and proceed to step 8. Step 8 (per-chapter summaries) is
   the *load-bearing* continuity surface; this last-1000-words
   quote is a flavour assist the chapter can be drafted without.
   We use the helper specifically to prevent the loop autonovel
   hit on author testing 2026-04-25, where `Read` with an off-by-one
   `offset/limit` triggered retry attempts on a prior chapter
   shorter than the requested line range.

8. **Read every prior summary** for narrative continuity. Use `file_read`
   on `books/{book}/chapters/ch_*.summary.md` for chapters 1 through
   `{prev}` (any that exist). Each file is ~150-250 words and contains
   the chapter's plot, character moves, threads opened, threads
   resolved. **These summaries are the load-bearing continuity
   context** that prevents chapter N from forgetting what chapter 1
   set up — much more important than the step-7 quote. If a summary
   is missing for a drafted chapter — likely a chapter drafted before
   this step shipped — note the gap but do not regenerate it inline;
   the user can backfill via `/autonovel:summarize-chapter`.

9. Use `task` to fan out loading of sibling-book chapters whose `story_time`
   is less than or equal to this chapter's `story_time`. Budget the loader —
   truncate oldest first, summarize rather than quote beyond ~8000 tokens.

10. Draft the chapter. Target length comes from
   `project.yaml :: defaults.chapter_target_words`. Obey `ANTI-PATTERNS.md`
   and `ANTI-SLOP.md`. Do not use any word that appears in
   `shared/period_bans.txt`.

11. Use `file_write` to write `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md`. Start
    with a YAML frontmatter block per `docs/chapter-frontmatter.md`:
    `book`, `chapter`, `pov`, `story_time` (ISO date or range), `events`,
    `status: drafted`, and `word_count`.

12. **Write the chapter summary.** Use `file_write` to save a
    150–250 word summary at
    `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.summary.md`. Cover seven
    things, each as a one or two sentence section:
      - **Plot:** what happened in this chapter (action, decisions,
        outcomes — not theme).
      - **Location:** the dominant setting in compact form, e.g.
        `Venice / Rialto`, `Augsburg / Fugger counting-house`,
        `Padua road`. One short phrase. When the chapter spans
        multiple locations, name the primary one (where the most
        on-page time happens) optionally with `+ <other>` after.
        This is what `/autonovel:chapter-summary` displays in the
        Plot column for at-a-glance "which chapters are set in X?"
        filtering — keep it succinct.
      - **POV state:** what the POV character knows, wants, fears at
        the close that they didn't at the open.
      - **Cast on stage:** every named character who appeared,
        with their role in this chapter (e.g. "Tommaso — POV;
        Niccolò — first appearance, declined to speak").
      - **Threads opened:** new mysteries, conflicts, promises this
        chapter introduced that future chapters need to pay off.
      - **Threads closed:** earlier setups this chapter resolved
        (cite the earlier chapter when known).
      - **Story time:** the ISO date or date range covered.
    Future drafts read this file as continuity context (step 8). It
    is NOT a chapter summary for the reader — it is a continuity
    handoff to the next drafter.

13. Use `file_write` to append any new candidate canon facts to
    `books/{book}/pending_canon.md`. If none are new, append a single line
    noting that no new facts were discovered in this chapter. Never edit
    `shared/canon.md` directly — that is what `autonovel promote-canon` is for.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` exists and is at least 2000 words.
- Its YAML frontmatter parses and contains `book`, `chapter`, `pov`,
  `story_time`, `events`, and `status: drafted`.
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.summary.md` exists and is between
  100 and 400 words.
- `books/{book}/pending_canon.md` has at least one new line appended (either
  a candidate fact or an explicit no-new-facts marker).
- No case-insensitive word-boundary match of any word from
  `shared/period_bans.txt` appears anywhere in the chapter body.
