<purpose>
Produce `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md` — the targeted revision
instructions the next `/autonovel:revise` run will follow literally.
Default source is `auto`: detect the weakest chapter and assemble a
brief from whatever artifacts are newest (eval log, cuts file, reader
panel). Successor to `gen_brief.py`.

A good brief names specific passages to change, not vague moods.
</purpose>

<workflow>
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Expect `<chapter-number> --book <short-name>`.
   `--from` is one of `cuts`, `eval`, `panel`, or `auto` (default
   `auto`). `--enrich-with <path>` (optional) names a research notes
   file (typically `shared/research/notes/<slug>.md` produced by
   `/autonovel:research`) whose detail the rewrite should weave in
   *lightly* — see step 5b. Missing required args are a usage error
   — print a one-line reminder and stop.

2. Use `file_read` on `project.yaml` and `books/{book}/voice.md` for
   voice guardrails the brief must preserve (body-first emotion, no
   telling after showing, no triadic sensory lists, 70%+ in-scene,
   etc. — pull these from the voice.md Part 2 body, don't invent them).

3. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md`. If
   missing, surface the gap and stop.

4. Load source artifacts per `--from`:
   - `cuts`: read
     `books/{book}/edit_logs/ch{chapter:02d}_cuts.json` (run
     `/autonovel:adversarial-edit` first if missing).
   - `eval`: read the most recent
     `books/{book}/eval_logs/ch{chapter:02d}_*.json` file.
   - `panel`: read `books/{book}/edit_logs/reader_panel.json` and
     isolate the entries that name this chapter number.
   - `auto`: read whichever of the above exist, preferring the most
     recent. If two or more exist, merge signals (cuts weighted highest
     because they're the most concrete).

5a. **Load enrichment research** (only when `--enrich-with <path>`
    was supplied). Use `file_read` on the named file. Treat the
    file's `## Material detail` and `## People and institutions`
    sections as the well to draw from. Identify which scenes in the
    chapter the research is *relevant to* — typically scenes where
    a person, place, institution, or material item from the
    research notes appears or could plausibly appear. Skip scenes
    where forcing in research detail would distort the chapter's
    existing focus. **The research is a brush, not a chisel:** the
    rewrite must add 1–2 period-specific details per relevant scene,
    not restructure or expand the chapter.

5. Draft the revision brief. Required sections, as Markdown H2s:
   - `## Chapter {chapter} — revision target` (one-line goal)
   - `## What works` (two or three sentences from the source material)
   - `## What drags` (concrete, quote-level, ordered by impact)
   - `## Specific cuts` (quoted passages to remove, carried over from
     the cuts JSON if present)
   - `## Specific rewrites` (before → after snippets where the source
     suggested them)
   - `## Voice guardrails` (bulleted — preserve from voice.md Part 2)
   - `## Enrichment from research` *(only when `--enrich-with` was
     given AND step 5a found at least one scene where the research
     is relevant)*. For each relevant scene, write one bullet:
       - **Scene index** (from the existing eval log's
         `beat_coverage.scenes` if available, otherwise eyeball it)
         and the scene's opening line as identifier.
       - **The research detail to add**, named specifically (a
         person's official title, a building's location, a material
         object's price or scale, a named institution's process).
         Quote the citation `[shortname]` from the notes so the
         rewrite knows the provenance.
       - **What NOT to change**: plot, dialogue, voice, scene
         structure, scene length (±5%), POV positioning. Enrichment
         is texture; the existing scenes stay shaped as they are.
     Cap at 4 enrichment bullets per chapter — more than that and
     the rewrite stops being light. Omit the section entirely when
     `--enrich-with` was not given OR no scenes warranted it
     (don't force-fit research where it doesn't belong; chapters
     that simply don't touch the researched topic stay clean).
   - `## Weak scenes` *(only when the eval log's
     `beat_coverage.weakest_scenes` array has any entries)* — for
     each entry, write one bullet naming the scene by index, the
     missing beat(s) (goal / conflict / disaster_or_decision /
     consequence), and the prescription verbatim from the eval log
     (or a sharpened version). This is what turns "tighten chapter
     8" into "scene 8.2 needs a decision before the break" — the
     single most surgical brief surface. Quote the scene's
     `opening_line` so the rewrite knows exactly which scene to
     touch. Omit the section when no scenes are weak.
   - `## Stability check` *(only when the eval log's
     `irreversible_change` score is below 7)* — name the chapter's
     final scene, name what reverted (board reset to opening / change
     softened / no consequence committed), and prescribe ONE specific
     irreversible commitment the rewrite must add: a death, a public
     revelation, a signed contract, a destroyed object, a refused
     offer, an oath broken, a door closed. Use the eval log's
     `irreversible_change.fix` verbatim or sharpen it; never fall
     back to vague "raise stakes" — the Stability Trap (AI's default
     to safe, round-edged endings) is the named ceiling failure from
     the Bells production, and only specific irreversible commitments
     break it. Omit the section when the score is ≥7.
   - `## Custom-rubric findings` *(only when present)* — for every
     criterion in the eval log's `custom_rubric` array (or the panel
     log's `custom_rubric` block) that scored below 6 or was named
     by any reader, write one bullet: the rule, the violation
     finding, and the prescription (what the revise should do
     instead). These are the book-specific rules from voice.md Part
     3. They are NOT optional — a brief that ignores a flagged
     custom-rubric finding will produce a revise that still violates
     the rule. Omit the section entirely when no findings apply.
   - `## Target length` (in words — the Bells learning is that
     `gen_revision` overshoots ~30%, so brief for `target × 0.77` if a
     final target applies)

6. Use `file_write` to save to
   `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md`. Overwrite any prior brief
   for this chapter — briefs are disposable working documents, not
   canonical artifacts.

7. Print the target length and the count of specific cuts / rewrites
   collected.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md` exists and contains every
  required H2 section from step 5.
- The brief quotes at least one passage from the chapter (no brief can
  be voice-only hand-waving; specificity is the point).
- `## Target length` names a word-count number, not a vague target.
