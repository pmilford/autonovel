<purpose>
Catches the bug class where period-correct vocabulary masks
modern syntax. The literal `period-bans` scanner flags
*words*; this command flags *sentence shape*. Pure mechanics —
the Flesch-Kincaid grade formula is well-defined math:

```
FK_grade = 0.39 × (words / sentences)
         + 11.8 × (syllables / words)
         - 15.59
```

Higher FK grade = harder reading = longer sentences with more
syllables-per-word. Period fiction often runs 9-12; modern
commercial fiction runs 5-8. The *delta* between a chapter and
the book's voice baseline matters more than the absolute number.

Baseline source (in priority order):
1. `books/{book}/voice.md` — the curated voice fingerprint, the
   authoritative read on intended register.
2. `books/{book}/seed.txt` — the user's pitch, written in the
   target voice.
3. Median of chapter grades (when neither of the above yields
   a usable baseline AND there are ≥3 chapters).

Chapters drifting more than `--threshold` (default 1.0 grade
level) above the baseline get flagged. The LLM judge in
`/autonovel:evaluate`'s `voice_adherence` dimension does the
actual scoring; this command surfaces the candidates.

**Review list, not a quality gate.** Real explanations for a
drifting chapter include intentional register shift (action
sequence, dialogue-heavy chapter, modernism homage) as well as
modern-syntax leakage. The user (or LLM judge) decides which.
</purpose>

<workflow>
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. `--book <short-name>` defaults via
   `_begin`. `--threshold <float>` (default 1.0).
   `--format markdown|json`.

2. Use the `Bash` tool to call the housekeeping helper. The
   helper reads `books/{book}/voice.md` (preferred baseline),
   `books/{book}/seed.txt` (fallback), and every `ch_NN.md`
   under `books/{book}/chapters/`:

   ```
   autonovel mechanical syntax-drift books/{book} --threshold {T} --format <format>
   ```

3. Print the helper's stdout verbatim. Do not editorialise.

4. Do not touch disk. This command is read-only by contract.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- No files are written.
- The output begins with `# Period syntax drift — <book>` and
  names the resolved baseline + source.
- A per-chapter table lists FK grade, delta-vs-baseline, and a
  flag when the absolute delta exceeds `--threshold`.
- When the baseline cannot be resolved (no voice.md / seed.txt
  AND fewer than 3 chapters), the output explains why and
  exits 0 cleanly.
- When `--format json`, every chapter and flag from the
  markdown is recoverable from the JSON payload.
