<purpose>
Rewrite chapter `{chapter}` of book `{book}` by following
`books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md` literally. Preserve voice,
world, and character continuity; obey the brief's cut list, rewrite
list, and target length. Successor to `gen_revision.py`. Bells
learning: the writer overshoots briefs by ~30%; the brief itself
already bakes in the ~0.77 correction, so write to the brief's stated
target, not a mental "safe" overshoot.
</purpose>

<workflow>
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Expect `<chapter-number> --book <short-name>`.
   Missing args are a usage error — stop with a one-line reminder.

2. Use `file_read` on `project.yaml` to resolve the book entry and the
   defaults block.

3. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md`. If the
   brief is missing, stop and surface:
   "run `/autonovel:brief {chapter} --book {book}` first".

3a. **Fold queued conversation suggestions into the brief.**
    Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/briefs/conversation.md` if it
    exists. Find every turn block where `Target: chapter {chapter}`
    AND `Status: queued`. Treat each such block's
    `Answer / suggestion:` body as additional brief content,
    appended to the main brief in your working memory. The
    conversation log entries are first-class brief input — they
    came from the author hand-curating edits via
    `/autonovel:talk`. If the file is missing or no queued entries
    target this chapter, proceed normally.

4. Use `file_read` on the shared canon: `shared/world.md`,
   `shared/characters.md`, `shared/canon.md`. These are guardrails, not
   raw material — the chapter must not contradict them.

5. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/voice.md` (Parts 1, 2, 3, AND 4).
   The voice fingerprint is the most important input after the
   brief.

   Part 3 is the custom rubric — book-specific writing rules the
   rewrite must honour. The brief's `## Custom-rubric findings`
   section names which rules were flagged in the prior eval; the
   rewrite must fix those *and* not introduce fresh violations of
   any other Part 3 rule.

   Part 4 is per-character voice fingerprints. When present, apply
   each character's block at every line of their dialogue AND (for
   the POV character) at every interiority sentence. The revise
   pass is the right place to *intensify* per-character voice — a
   first draft often has every character converging on the
   narrator's register; the rewrite should make each character
   recognisable from a single line of dialogue. If a character's
   line in the prior draft could plausibly belong to any other
   speaker in the book, that's the line to rewrite first.

6. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` (the
   current draft — the raw material the rewrite carves from). This
   read IS load-bearing; if it fails, stop with a one-line message
   ("cannot read current chapter; check books/{book}/chapters/").

   Then, **best-effort (do not retry on failure)**, use the `Bash`
   tool to run exactly once:

   ```
   autonovel _tail-chapter --book {book} --chapter {prev} --words 2000
   ```

   The helper reads `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{prev}.md`, strips
   YAML frontmatter, and prints the last 2000 words of the previous
   chapter as continuity flavour, in one deterministic shot (no
   `file_read` line-range gymnastics). If the helper exits non-zero
   or returns no output: **do not retry** — note the gap in the
   eval log and proceed without the prior-chapter quote. The brief
   is the load-bearing input here; the quote is a flavour assist.

7. Draft the rewrite. Follow the brief exactly. Honor the anti-pattern
   rules:
   - No triadic sensory lists (X. Y. Z.)
   - No "He did not [verb]" more than once
   - No "He thought about [X]" constructions
   - No "the way [X] did [Y]" more than twice
   - No "not X, but Y" formula in narration
   - No over-explaining after showing
   - At most two section breaks
   - At least one moment that genuinely surprises
   - 70%+ in-scene (dialogue and action, not summary)
   - Dialogue sounds like speech, not written prose
   Preserve the chapter's YAML frontmatter (`book`, `chapter`, `pov`,
   `story_time`, `events`) verbatim; update `status` to `revised` and
   recompute `word_count`.

8. Use `file_write` to overwrite
   `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` with the full revised
   chapter. Do not truncate. Do not summarize.

9. **Regenerate the chapter summary.** Use `file_write` to overwrite
   `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.summary.md` with a fresh
   150–250 word continuity summary. **The shape and section list
   are exactly those defined in `/autonovel:draft` step 12** — see
   that file for the canonical seven labelled sections (Location,
   Plot, POV state, Cast on stage, Threads opened, Threads closed,
   Story time). Do NOT inline a different list here; defer to
   draft.md's spec so the two stay in sync. The summary must
   reflect the *revised* chapter, not the draft it replaced.

   Specifically: if the chapter's setting changed in the rewrite
   (a scene moved from Venice to Padua, say), update the **Location**
   field accordingly. Cast on stage entries are similarly
   refreshed for the new prose. The whole point of regenerating
   the summary post-revise is that downstream readers (the next
   chapter's drafter, `/autonovel:chapter-summary`'s table) see
   the current state, not the pre-revision one.

10. Use `file_write` to append any new candidate canon facts to
    `books/{book}/pending_canon.md` (or add a single `no new facts`
    line if the rewrite established nothing new). Never edit
    `shared/canon.md` directly — that is what `/autonovel:promote-canon`
    is for.

11. **Mark folded conversation entries as applied.** If step 3a
    found queued turns targeting this chapter, use `file_write` to
    rewrite `books/{book}/briefs/conversation.md` with each of
    those turn blocks' `Status:` line changed from `queued` to
    `applied`. Other turns and other fields must be preserved
    byte-for-byte — only the matching `Status: queued` lines flip
    to `Status: applied`. If no entries were folded, do not touch
    the file.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` exists, parses YAML
  frontmatter, and carries `status: revised` plus a fresh `word_count`.
- The rewrite differs from the prior draft (not a byte-for-byte copy).
- Chapter length is within ±15% of the brief's stated target.
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.summary.md` exists and reflects
  the revised chapter (mtime is newer than the chapter file's prior
  draft).
- `books/{book}/pending_canon.md` grows by at least one line (either a
  candidate fact or the explicit `no new facts` marker).
- Any `briefs/conversation.md` entries with
  `Target: chapter {chapter}` + `Status: queued` are flipped to
  `Status: applied` exactly once. Untouched turns are byte-identical.
