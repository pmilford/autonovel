<purpose>
The "let it write the rest of the book" command. Drafts a range of
chapters end-to-end, fixes low-scoring chapters with brief+revise,
runs anachronism checks, and promotes pending canon at the end so
the final state is coherent — `shared/canon.md` reflects everything
the sweep discovered, every chapter is at or above threshold (or
explicitly flagged as below), and continuity summaries are fresh.

Per chapter, in ascending chapter-number order, sequentially:

  1. `draft N`              — full /autonovel:draft workflow
                              (writes ch_NN.md, ch_NN.summary.md,
                              appends pending_canon)
  2. `check-anachronism N`  — period-vocabulary + LLM semantic check
                              (skip via --no-anachronism)
  3. `evaluate N`           — score the new draft (skip via --skip-eval)
  4. **If score < threshold** AND --no-revise-low NOT set:
     a. `brief N --from auto`   — synthesize revision brief
     b. `revise N`              — rewrite per the brief; regenerates
                                  the chapter summary
     c. `evaluate N` again      — re-score
     d. keep whichever version scored higher; the other is in the
        checkpoint and recoverable via autonovel rollback
  5. **`promote-canon`** (skip via --no-promote)  — fold the new
                              pending_canon entries from this chapter
                              into shared/canon.md *before* moving on
                              to chapter N+1. Critical: chapter N+1's
                              draft must see the canonical facts
                              chapter N just established, otherwise
                              N+1 invents conflicting versions of the
                              same fact (e.g. chapter N establishes
                              Tommaso's age in 1521; chapter N+1
                              gives a different age). Research-tagged
                              entries still win contradictions per
                              the standard promote-canon discipline.

After every chapter in the range completes:

  6. **Final promote-canon sweep** (skip via --no-promote) — catch
     anything still pending (typically from the last chapter's
     revise loop). Idempotent: if the per-chapter promotes already
     consumed everything, this is a no-op.

Sequential only — drafts cannot run in parallel because chapter N+1's
draft reads chapter N's prose and summary. Same per-chapter
*drafting* quality as `/autonovel:draft N` repeated; the wrap is
about adding the immediate-fix-on-low-score loop and the canon
propagation that makes the *whole-book* result coherent.

When NOT to use this:

- Early in a series (chapters 1-3) when you're calibrating voice.
  Use per-chapter `/autonovel:draft` so you can fix voice before
  drift compounds.
- When you need a heavy revision pass: that's
  `/autonovel:revision-pass`, which adds adversarial-edit +
  reader-panel + multi-cycle iteration. draft-pass is a one-pass
  command; revision-pass is the multi-pass deepener.

When TO use this:

- Foundation is solid. Voice is set. You want a coherent
  first-draft-plus-immediate-fix of every remaining chapter and
  you'd rather review the whole book at once afterwards than each
  chapter in isolation.
- After a major change (added a character, restructured a chapter)
  and you want to redraft a range with the new context.
</purpose>

<workflow>
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Required: `--chapters <range>`.
   Range can be `N-M` (inclusive), `N,M,K` (comma-separated), or
   `all` (every chapter named in the outline that lacks a chapter
   file). Optional flags:
     - `--book` (defaults via `_begin`)
     - `--retry-below <score>` (default project.yaml::defaults
       .chapter_threshold; below this, the revise loop fires)
     - `--no-revise-low` (skip step 4; just redraft once on low
       score)
     - `--no-anachronism` (skip step 2)
     - `--no-promote` (skip step 5)
     - `--skip-eval` (skip steps 3 and 4 entirely; pure drafting)
     - `--deep` (after promote-canon, also run the whole-book
       reader-panel + Opus dual-persona review; produces reports
       at `books/{book}/edit_logs/reader_panel.md` and
       `books/{book}/edit_logs/opus_review.md`. Does NOT
       auto-revise from those reports — the user reviews them and
       decides whether to run a follow-up `/autonovel:revision-pass
       --chapters <list>`. ~10-25 extra minutes of compute on a
       70k-word book.)
   Missing `--chapters` → stop with usage hint.

2. Use `file_read` on `project.yaml`. Resolve the book entry, `pov`,
   `defaults.chapter_target_words`, `defaults.chapter_threshold`.
   Read `books/{book}/outline.md` to identify chapter numbers
   defined; resolve `all` to outlined chapters that lack a chapter
   file.

3. **For each chapter N in the resolved range, in ascending order,
   spawn a `task` subagent.**

   Per-chapter execution runs in a *fresh* subagent conversation,
   not in this parent conversation. The parent only sees the
   subagent's one-line return value. This is what makes long
   sweeps feasible: in the old in-line model, each chapter inflated
   the parent conversation with chapter-of-prose-plus-tool-output
   and a 19-chapter sweep would exhaust context around chapter
   8-10. With Task subagents, parent context grows by ~16 short
   strings across the run.

   Drafts MUST be sequential (N+1 reads N's prose and summary), so
   spawn one Task at a time and wait for the result before the next.

   For each chapter N:

   a. Use the `task` tool to spawn a subagent. Description:
      `Draft chapter N of book {book} (autonovel pipeline)`. Allowed
      tools: Read, Write, Bash, WebSearch (for research-note
      fallbacks). Model: standard tier (sonnet 4.6 for draft;
      heavier sub-steps run their own).

      Prompt for the subagent (substitute {book}, N, threshold,
      and the active flags into this template; keep structure
      verbatim so subagents behave consistently):

      ```
      You are running ONE chapter (chapter N) of an autonovel
      draft-pass for book {book}. The PARENT command holds
      .autonovel/in-progress.lock — do NOT call `autonovel _begin`
      or `autonovel _end` inside this task.

      Threshold for the revise loop: {threshold}.
      Skip flags in effect: {flags}.

      Run these steps in order, each one inline (do not invoke
      slash-commands):

      1. DRAFT (full /autonovel:draft body — see the canonical
         workflow at ~/.claude/commands/autonovel/draft.md if you
         need to refer back). Read project.yaml, shared/world.md,
         shared/characters.md, shared/canon.md, shared/events.md,
         books/{book}/voice.md, books/{book}/outline.md (locate
         chapter N's beats), books/{book}/chapters/ch_*.summary.md
         (rolling continuity), and run
         `autonovel _tail-chapter --book {book} --chapter {N-1}
         --words 1000` for prior tail (best-effort, no retry).
         Write books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.md with YAML
         frontmatter + the 150-250 word
         books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.summary.md. Append
         candidate canon facts to
         books/{book}/pending_canon.md.

      2. ANACHRONISM (skip if --no-anachronism is in flags):
         run `autonovel mechanical period-bans
         books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.md
         shared/period_bans.txt` plus a brief LLM semantic
         pass. Combined report at
         books/{book}/edit_logs/ch{N:02d}_anachronism.md. Capture
         the total hit count.

      3. EVALUATE (skip if --skip-eval):
         reproduce the /autonovel:evaluate --chapter N body —
         judge the chapter on the standard chapter dimensions,
         run `autonovel mechanical slop`,
         `autonovel mechanical cliches`,
         `autonovel mechanical sensory` for mechanical penalties.
         Write books/{book}/eval_logs/ch{N:02d}_eval.json.
         Capture overall_score as score_v1.

      4. REVISE LOOP (skip if --skip-eval or --no-revise-low or
         score_v1 ≥ threshold):
         a. Brief from eval+anachronism: write
            books/{book}/briefs/ch{N:02d}.md with named-passage
            prescriptions.
         b. Revise: rewrite books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.md
            per the brief. Regenerate
            books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.summary.md.
         c. Re-evaluate. score_v2.
         d. Keep whichever version scored higher; the other
            version is in the preamble checkpoint and recoverable
            via autonovel rollback.

      5. PROMOTE CANON (skip if --no-promote):
         reproduce /autonovel:promote-canon's body against
         books/{book}/pending_canon.md only (the per-chapter
         scope — the parent will run a final sweep over all
         books at end). Merge into shared/canon.md;
         research-tagged entries win contradictions. Capture the
         count of entries promoted.

      Return EXACTLY this single line as your final message
      (nothing else):

      [ch N] draft Xw · anach Y · eval s1 [→ revise → eval s2] · final s · canon +P

      Where: X = final word count, Y = anachronism hit count or
      "—" if skipped, s1 = score_v1, s2 = score_v2 (only if
      revise ran; otherwise "—"), s = the kept score, P = count
      of canon entries promoted (or "—" if --no-promote).
      ```

   b. Capture the subagent's return string. Append to the running
      progress list (you will print these in the summary at step
      6). Print the line immediately so the user has live progress.

   c. Move to chapter N+1. The subagent terminates; its working
      memory (the chapter prose, the eval JSON, the brief, etc.)
      is discarded — only the one-line summary persists in your
      parent context.

   **Critical: do NOT call `autonovel _begin` or `autonovel _end`
   yourself, and do not let the subagent call them either. The
   parent command holds the series lock for the entire sweep.**

4. **Final promote-canon sweep** (skip if `--no-promote`). After
   the loop completes, run promote-canon one last time to catch
   anything pending that didn't get promoted in the per-chapter
   step (typically: revise-loop additions in the very last
   chapter, or any other book's pending file if this series has
   multiple books). This is idempotent — if the per-chapter
   promotes already consumed everything, the call is a no-op
   summary line.

5. **Deep whole-book review** (only if `--deep`):

   a. Reproduce `/autonovel:reader-panel --book {book}`'s workflow
      inline. Four-persona pass over the full manuscript; writes
      `books/{book}/edit_logs/reader_panel.md`.
   b. Reproduce `/autonovel:review --book {book}`'s workflow
      inline. Opus dual-persona (literary critic + professor of
      fiction) pass; writes `books/{book}/edit_logs/opus_review.md`.

   Both produce REPORTS, not chapter changes. The summary table in
   step (6) names which chapters each report flags so the user can
   pick what to act on. The natural next step is
   `/autonovel:revision-pass --chapters <list>` against the flagged
   chapters, or `/autonovel:revise <N>` per chapter for the deepest
   issues. We do NOT auto-revise from these reports because (a)
   they often disagree with each other, and (b) a structural
   recommendation (e.g. "cut chapter 12") needs human judgement.

6. **Print a summary table** in the postamble footer:

   ```
   chapter | draft (words) | anach | eval v1 | eval v2 | final | revised?
   --------|---------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|----------
        4  | 3100          | 0     | 7.4     | —       | 7.4   | no
        5  | 2950          | 2     | 5.9     | 6.7     | 6.7   | yes
        6  | 3200          | 1     | 6.8     | —       | 6.8   | no
   ```

   Plus a one-paragraph headline ("Drafted 3 chapters; 1 revised
   on low score; 4 candidate canon entries promoted; 0 conflicts.").

   With `--deep`: append a second block showing reader-panel and
   review highlights — top 3 panel concerns, top 3 review items —
   plus the chapter list each one flags. This is the user's
   shopping list for the next revision-pass.

7. The postamble's standard footer recommends the next step.
   Common cases:
     - With `--deep`, panel + review surfaced specific chapters →
       `/autonovel:revision-pass --chapters <those>` is the natural
       next move (acts on those reports).
     - Without `--deep`, all chapters ≥ threshold and no conflicts →
       `/autonovel:reader-panel --book {book}` then
       `/autonovel:review --book {book}` for whole-book depth (or
       re-run `draft-pass --deep` to do both at once next time).
     - One or more chapters still below threshold →
       `/autonovel:revision-pass --chapters <those>` for the
       multi-pass deepener.
     - Canon conflicts parked → resolve them by hand-editing
       `pending_canon.md` (the `# Conflicts` section) and re-running
       `/autonovel:promote-canon`.

<files-touched>
This sweep delegates to the same set of files each underlying command
touches. For the contract record:

Reads:
- `project.yaml`
- `shared/world.md`, `shared/characters.md`, `shared/canon.md`,
  `shared/events.md`, `shared/period_bans.txt`
- `shared/research/notes/*.md` (when the outline names them)
- `books/{book}/voice.md`, `books/{book}/outline.md`
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` (during retry / revise)
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_*.summary.md` (rolling continuity)
- `books/{book}/eval_logs/ch{chapter:02d}_eval.json` (read by brief --from auto)
- `books/{book}/edit_logs/ch{chapter:02d}_anachronism.md` (read between eval and brief)

Writes (per chapter in range, plus the end-of-sweep promote):
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md`
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.summary.md`
- `books/{book}/eval_logs/ch{chapter:02d}_eval.json`
- `books/{book}/edit_logs/ch{chapter:02d}_anachronism.md`
- `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md` (only if revise loop fires)
- `books/{book}/pending_canon.md`
- `shared/canon.md` (only at end-of-sweep promote, only if not --no-promote)
</files-touched>

<acceptance>
- For every chapter N in the resolved range,
  `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.md` exists, parses YAML
  frontmatter, is at least 2000 words.
- For every chapter N,
  `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{N:02d}.summary.md` exists and is
  100-400 words.
- Unless `--skip-eval` was passed, every chapter has a fresh
  `books/{book}/eval_logs/ch{N:02d}_eval.json`.
- Unless `--no-anachronism`, every chapter has a fresh
  `books/{book}/edit_logs/ch{N:02d}_anachronism.md`.
- Unless `--no-revise-low` or `--skip-eval`, every chapter that
  scored below threshold on its first eval has a corresponding
  `books/{book}/briefs/ch{N:02d}.md` from the revise loop, and the
  final chapter file is whichever version (draft or revise) scored
  higher.
- Unless `--no-promote`, the sweep ends with at most a few entries
  remaining in `books/{book}/pending_canon.md` (only the conflicts).
- A summary table is printed in the postamble footer.
