<purpose>
Sidequest: a lighter-weight version of `/autonovel:add-subplot`.
Plant a single image, object, or line in chapter `N`; pay it off —
as a callback, not a new storyline — in chapter `M`. No new
characters, no new plot beat. Two chapters touched; one checkpoint.

Use this when you want the foreshadowing discipline without the
subplot machinery: the goal is texture and return, not arc.
</purpose>

<workflow>
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Required: `--plant <N>`, `--payoff <M>`,
   `--thread "<desc>"`, `--book <short-name>`. Reject `M <= N`.
   The `<desc>` is used as the thread label and as the brief's
   heading.

2. Use `file_read` on `project.yaml`, `shared/characters.md`,
   `shared/canon.md`, `books/{book}/voice.md`,
   `books/{book}/outline.md`, and both target chapters
   (`books/{book}/chapters/ch_{plant}.md` and
   `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{payoff}.md`).

3. Append a ledger line to `books/{book}/outline.md` under a
   `## Threads` section (create if absent):

       - Plant ch_{plant:02d} / Payoff ch_{payoff:02d}: <thread>

4. For each of the two chapters, draft a tight brief and rewrite:

   - Brief format: H1 `# Chapter <N> — foreshadow: <thread>`; H2
     sections `## What lands here`, `## Specific rewrite`, and
     `## Target length` (current ± 100 words).
   - Plant chapter: the rewrite must add the image/line/object
     without pointing at it. The reader should not yet know it
     matters. Prefer one sentence of concrete detail over a
     paragraph of foreshadowing.
   - Payoff chapter: the rewrite must echo the plant — same
     image, same object, same line, possibly inverted — in a
     moment of decision or realization. Do not explain the
     callback.

   Use `file_write` for each brief under
   `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md`, then overwrite
   `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` with the revised
   chapter. Preserve YAML; set `status: revised`; recompute
   `word_count`.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- `books/{book}/outline.md` gains a ledger line under `## Threads`
  naming both chapters.
- Both chapters parse YAML frontmatter and carry `status: revised`.
- Neither rewrite changes the chapter's word count by more than
  ±10%.
- Two briefs exist under `books/{book}/briefs/`, each naming the
  thread in its H1.
</acceptance>
