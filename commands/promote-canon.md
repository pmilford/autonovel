<purpose>
Move candidate facts out of per-book scratchpads
(`books/{book}/pending_canon.md`) and into the series-wide
`shared/canon.md`. This is the one command that writes `shared/canon.md`
— `/autonovel:revise`, `/autonovel:draft`, and every other chapter
command are forbidden from editing it directly (§19), because two books
drafting chapters in parallel both appending to the same file is a
cross-book race condition.

Single-threading is enforced by `.autonovel/in-progress.lock` (acquired
by the preamble); inside the critical section the command:
1. reads every pending file,
2. de-duplicates against existing canon,
3. rejects contradictions,
4. appends the survivors to `shared/canon.md` with provenance
   (which book / chapter proposed them),
5. empties every pending file it consumed.

The preamble's checkpoint captures both `shared/canon.md` and the
pending files, so `autonovel rollback` undoes the whole promotion.
</purpose>

<workflow>
> **Implementation note (2026-04-26):** the entire de-dup /
> contradiction-detection / supersedure / conflict-block logic is
> implemented in `src/autonovel/promote_canon.py` and exposed as
> the hidden CLI subcommand `autonovel _promote-canon`. This
> command's body simply invokes the helper (with the lock acquired
> by the standard preamble); the prose below describes the
> behaviour the helper implements, NOT a separate inline workflow
> the LLM should reproduce. The same helper is invoked by sweep
> sub-agents with `--no-lock` (see `revision-pass.md` step 3f and
> `draft-pass.md` step 5) so there's exactly one source of truth
> for the file-operation semantics.

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. `--book <short-name>` restricts the sweep to
   one book's pending file. `--dry-run` prints what would be
   promoted without writing. No positional arguments.

2. **Invoke the helper.** Use the `Bash` tool to run:

   ```
   autonovel _promote-canon [--book <name>] [--dry-run] --format json
   ```

   The CLI does steps 3–8 inline (parse pending, classify against
   canon/world/characters, emit `## Promoted` and `## Superseded`
   blocks in `shared/canon.md`, rewrite `pending_canon.md` with
   either the structured `# Conflicts` block or `no new facts`).
   Parse the JSON output for the per-book counts to feed step 9's
   summary. Steps 3–8 below remain authoritative descriptions of
   the helper's behaviour for review purposes — they are NOT a
   separate inline workflow.

   When `--book` is omitted, the helper iterates every book in
   `project.yaml`. When `--dry-run` is passed, no files are
   modified — the JSON report names what would have happened.

   The slash-command's preamble already acquired the in-progress
   lock; the helper runs without `--no-lock`. Sub-agents in
   sweeps invoke the same helper with `--no-lock` (see
   `revision-pass.md` step 3f and `draft-pass.md` step 5) which
   bypasses the lock check — that's the safe in-sweep entry point
   for the same logic.

3. For each selected book, use `file_read` on
   `books/{book}/pending_canon.md`. Parse it as a plain bullet list
   (each non-empty line starting with `-` is one candidate entry).
   Lines that read `no new facts` (case-insensitive) are skipped —
   they are the `revise` command's placeholder for "I wrote nothing
   new" and carry no payload.

4. Use `file_read` on `shared/canon.md`, `shared/world.md`, and
   `shared/characters.md`. The existing canon is the baseline for
   de-duplication and contradiction detection:
   - **Duplicate**: an entry whose substantive content is already
     stated (possibly in different words) in `shared/canon.md`.
     Discard silently; record it under the per-book discard list
     for the summary.
   - **Contradiction**: an entry that contradicts `shared/canon.md`,
     `shared/world.md`, or `shared/characters.md`. Default-discard
     and record under the per-book conflict list — but with one
     exception below. **Capture which of the three files holds the
     contradicting line** along with the line itself; both fields
     are required by step 8's conflict-block output so the user knows
     which file to edit when resolving.

     **Exception — research-tagged entries win contradictions.** A
     pending entry carrying a `[research:<slug>]` tag was written
     by `/autonovel:research --from-seed` and is backed by a cited
     primary source (the `[shortname]` next to it resolves in
     `shared/sources.bib`). When such an entry contradicts existing
     canon, prefer the research entry: promote it, AND additionally
     emit a `## Superseded <UTC-date>` block in `shared/canon.md`
     listing the prior canonical line and a one-sentence rationale
     ("research note `<slug>` cites [<shortname>] for <new value>;
     prior value was <old value>"). The user reviewing
     `shared/canon.md` then sees both the new fact and the old one
     with a clear paper trail. This is what makes
     `/autonovel:research --from-seed` → `/autonovel:promote-canon`
     a fully automatic update path: research's citations beat the
     LLM's general-knowledge guesses, and the supersedure is
     visible.
   - **Survivor**: neither duplicate nor contradiction. Promote.

5. For each surviving entry, rewrite it into the canonical form:

   ```
   - <fact> (from {book} ch_{chapter:02d})
   ```

   For research-tagged entries, use:

   ```
   - <fact> [shortname] (from research note <slug>)
   ```

   so the citation makes it into the canonical entry. The
   `(from …)` provenance lets future audits trace every canon
   fact back to the chapter or research note that established it.
   If the pending entry already carries a provenance tail, keep it
   verbatim.

6. If `--dry-run`, print a per-book report and stop — do NOT write
   anything. Format:

   ```
   book: {book}
     promoted: N
     duplicates: M
     conflicts:
       - <entry> — contradicts: <canon line>
   ```

7. Otherwise, use `file_write` to append the survivors to
   `shared/canon.md`. Append under a dated heading:
   `## Promoted <UTC-date>` (one heading per invocation). Keep the
   existing body of `shared/canon.md` verbatim; do not rewrite it.

8. Use `file_write` to rewrite each consumed
   `books/{book}/pending_canon.md`. After a successful promotion the
   file contains either:

   **(a) Conflicts to resolve.** When at least one entry was rejected
   as a contradiction, write the file in this exact self-documenting
   format. The HTML-comment block at the top is mandatory — it is
   the user's instruction sheet for *how* to act on each conflict,
   and the previous "just dump the bullet lines" format was
   reported (2026-04-26) as making resolution unclear:

   ````markdown
   # Conflicts — resolve before next promote-canon

   <!--
   HOW TO RESOLVE A CONFLICT
   =========================

   Each `## Conflict N` block below names a pending candidate that
   couldn't be promoted because it contradicts something in
   shared/canon.md, shared/world.md, or shared/characters.md. For
   each conflict, pick ONE of the three resolutions and act:

     (A) ACCEPT the new fact (replace the existing one)
         1. Open the file named in `Existing canon (in: ...)`.
         2. Replace the old line (quoted under `Existing canon`)
            with the new line (quoted under `New candidate`). Keep
            the canonical bullet shape: `- <fact> (from <source>)`.
         3. Delete the entire `## Conflict N` block from THIS file.
         4. Re-run /autonovel:promote-canon. The conflict is gone.

     (B) REJECT the new fact (the existing one stays)
         1. Delete the entire `## Conflict N` block from THIS file.
         2. (Optional but recommended) fix the chapter that
            re-introduced the wrong fact, so it doesn't come back
            on the next draft / revise. The chapter is named under
            `Source`. Run:
              /autonovel:brief <N> --book <book>
              /autonovel:revise <N> --book <book>

     (C) BOTH ARE WRONG
         1. Edit the file named in `Existing canon (in: ...)` to
            the correct value.
         2. Delete the entire `## Conflict N` block from THIS file.
         3. Re-run /autonovel:promote-canon to land any newly
            consistent pending entries.

   After your edits, re-run /autonovel:promote-canon. Resolved
   conflicts disappear; anything still contradictory is re-emitted
   on the next run with the same instructions.
   -->

   ## Conflict 1
   - **New candidate:** `- <pending entry as it would have been promoted>`
   - **Existing canon (in: <relative file path>):** `- <existing line, verbatim>`
   - **Why they conflict:** <one sentence — what specifically disagrees>
   - **Source:** (from <book> ch_<NN>) — *or* — (from research note <slug>)

   ## Conflict 2
   ...
   ````

   Each conflict gets its own `## Conflict N` block. Number the
   blocks 1..K in the order conflicts were detected (stable across
   re-runs so the user editing N=3 doesn't have it renumber under
   them). The `Existing canon (in: ...)` field is required — name
   the actual file path that holds the contradicting line, NOT
   just "canon" — because conflicts can be against `shared/canon.md`,
   `shared/world.md`, or `shared/characters.md` and the user
   needs to know which file to edit.

   **(b) No conflicts.** When every pending entry was either
   promoted or dropped as duplicate, write a single line:

   ```
   no new facts
   ```

   That single-line form is what `revise` / `draft` / `revision-pass`
   then append fresh candidates to on subsequent runs. Do NOT leave
   the file empty (some tooling treats an empty file as
   "uninitialised" rather than "settled").

9. **Print the postamble summary AND specific next-step guidance.**
   The user sees this output the moment promote-canon finishes;
   they should never have to read docs to know what to do next.
   Format:

   ```
   promoted: <N>
   duplicates: <M>
   conflicts:  <K>
   supersedures: <S>   (research-tagged entries that replaced existing canon)

   Next:
     <one or more of the lines below, depending on what happened>
   ```

   Pick the next-step lines from this decision tree. **Print every
   line that applies; do not collapse them into a single
   recommendation.** Multiple categories can apply in one run.

   **(a) Supersedures landed (S > 0).** For each `## Superseded`
   block written to `shared/canon.md` this run, identify the
   chapter that introduced the OLD canon line by parsing its
   provenance tail (`(from <book> ch_<NN>)`). That chapter likely
   still references the now-wrong value in its prose. **Always
   recommend `/autonovel:revision-pass`** — it runs the whole
   per-chapter loop (anachronism → brief → revise → evaluate →
   promote-canon) in one command, which is what the user wants
   regardless of whether 1 chapter or 10 are affected. The 3-step
   atomic sequence (check-anachronism → brief → revise) is for
   surgical work where the user wants to inspect each artifact
   between steps; almost no post-promote-canon revision is that
   surgical.

   Single chapter:

   ```
     - Chapter <NN> (<book>) introduced the prior value of
       "<short description>". Update its prose:
           /autonovel:revision-pass --chapters <NN> --book <book>
   ```

   Multiple chapters:

   ```
     - <S> chapters introduced now-superseded values:
       <list of "ch_NN (<book>)" with the prior values>.
       Update them in one sweep:
           /autonovel:revision-pass --chapters <comma-list> --book <book>
   ```

   For users who specifically want the surgical 3-step path (rare),
   add a one-line "or run them individually" footnote ONLY when
   exactly 1 chapter is affected:

   ```
       (Surgical alternative — inspect between steps:
            /autonovel:check-anachronism <NN> --book <book>
            /autonovel:brief <NN> --book <book> --from auto
            /autonovel:revise <NN> --book <book>)
   ```

   **(b) Conflicts written back (K > 0).** Print:

   ```
     - <K> conflict(s) need human resolution. Open
           books/<book>/pending_canon.md
       and follow the HOW TO RESOLVE A CONFLICT block at the top
       of the file (three resolution paths: accept / reject / both
       wrong). Re-run /autonovel:promote-canon after editing.
   ```

   **(c) Plain successful promote (N > 0, S = 0, K = 0).** Print:

   ```
     - Canon updated. Continue with /autonovel:next.
   ```

   **(d) Nothing to do (N = M = K = S = 0; every pending file
   said `no new facts`).** Print:

   ```
     - No pending facts to promote. Continue with /autonovel:next.
   ```

   The point of (a) specifically is the answer to "what now?"
   after a successful research-driven supersedure. Without it the
   user has to grep their own chapters to find what referenced the
   old value — the command already knows the answer (the
   provenance tail of the superseded line) and should print it.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- If `--dry-run`, no files under `shared/` or `books/*/` change.
- Otherwise, `shared/canon.md` contains a `## Promoted <UTC-date>`
  heading with at least one entry, unless every pending file was
  empty or said `no new facts`.
- For every book whose pending file contained only non-conflicting
  entries, `books/{book}/pending_canon.md` ends with `no new facts`.
- Contradictions are never silently merged: they are preserved under
  the `# Conflicts — resolve before next promote-canon` header in
  the pending file using the structured `## Conflict N` block format
  from step 8, including the mandatory HTML-comment instruction
  block at the top. Each conflict block names: the new candidate,
  the existing canon line, the file the existing line lives in, a
  one-sentence rationale, and the source (chapter or research note).
- A pending file containing conflicts NEVER also contains a
  `no new facts` marker — the two states are mutually exclusive.
