<purpose>
Sidequest: compress a single chapter to a target word count. Writes a
compression brief, then rewrites the chapter from it — all in one
checkpoint, so `autonovel rollback` undoes the whole operation.

Bells learning: any chapter below ~1800 words becomes the new weakest
chapter; this command refuses to brief below 1800 words, no matter
what the user asks for. The sweet spot for compressed chapters is
2200-3000w.
</purpose>

<workflow>
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Expect `--chapter <N> --book <short-name>
   --target-words <W>`. All three are required. If `W` is less than
   1800, stop with: "target_words must be >= 1800 (see Bells
   compression floor)".

2. Use `file_read` on `project.yaml` and `books/{book}/voice.md` for
   voice guardrails (these must not drift during compression).

3. Use `file_read` on `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md`. Count
   the current words. If the chapter is already at or under the
   target, stop with: "chapter already at target (W words)".

4. Draft a compression brief. Identify the passages that dilute
   tension: over-explaining, narrator summary where a scene was
   already dramatized, restated beats. Keep what earns its place;
   cut what restates. Allocate the cut across the chapter evenly —
   do not trim only the ending, which is where the chapter's
   irreversible change must land.

5. Use `file_write` to save the brief to
   `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md` with an H1 header
   `# Chapter {chapter} — compression to {target} words` and the
   standard brief sections (What works / What drags / Specific cuts /
   Voice guardrails / Target length).

6. Rewrite the chapter from that brief. Preserve the YAML frontmatter
   (update `status` to `revised`, recompute `word_count`). Use
   `file_write` to overwrite `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md`.
</workflow>

<acceptance>
- `books/{book}/chapters/ch_{chapter}.md` exists and parses YAML
  frontmatter.
- The rewritten chapter's word count is within ±10% of
  `target-words`, and not below 1800.
- `books/{book}/briefs/ch{chapter:02d}.md` exists and names the
  target word count.
